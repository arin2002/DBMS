)
// desc for displaying primary key

INSERT INTO Customer VALUES(1, 'arin','dehradun',date '2002-07-01',1234567891);
INSERT INTO Customer VALUES(2, 'rahul','haridwar',date '2002-07-03',0931284171);
INSERT INTO Customer VALUES(3, 'rohan','bihar',date '2002-07-08',9281739171);
INSERT INTO Customer VALUES(4, 'payal','dehradun',date '2002-02-01',1839371831);
INSERT INTO Customer VALUES(5, 'neha','delhi',date '2002-04-01',9381371891);
